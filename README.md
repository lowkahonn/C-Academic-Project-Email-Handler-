# C++ Academic Project (Email Handler)

It is a command prompt application, where a simulated email system is established.
This application can allow you to store the emails that you sent or received.
(well, it can't really send and receive emails, instead users need to add emails manually in the application)

There are several things you can do:
1. Add Emails
2. Delete Emails
3. Sort & Display Emails
4. Display Emails
